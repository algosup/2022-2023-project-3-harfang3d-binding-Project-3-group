# Test policy
## Mission of testing
We realize a test process to anticipate all the risks that would impact our solution and make sure to deliver a working solution to our customer HARFANG 3D.

## Test objectives
The objective of our software testing is to integrate the risk management process to identify any risk as soon as possible in the development process.
We also comply with legal and regulatory requirements. We need to bring a solution that verifies the test objectâ€™s compliance with such requirements or standards:
- This objective ensures that our software is developed to be in line with the national and international standards of testing.
- We have ISO, IEC and IEEE 29119 standards that deal with the software testing concept.
<!-- need to check ISO, IEC, IEEE 29119 -->
### Test level performed
| Level                   	| Objectives                                                                                                      	|
|-------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Unit test               	| Detect defective code in units and reduce risk of unit failure in Production                                    	|
| Regression testing      	| Ensure no new defects have been introduced (in case of enhancements or defect fix)                              	|
| User acceptance testing 	| Confirm the system works as expected by the customer and the end-user                                           	|
| Operational testing     	| Checks the reliability and performance of the software and should be tested to find out if it works as expected 	|
